                At Dianne Adair we are continuing to monitor the current situation and daily changes that are
                happening across our country and communities as efforts are made to slow down the spread of
                COVID - 19. *As of today Dianne Adair Day Care Centers will remain closed through Spring
                Break. Our current plan is to reopen on Monday April 13th. During this closure through April
                10th, Dianne Adair will continue to pay all employees their normal wages. Parents will be billed
                based on their contracted hours starting April 13th. Bills will not go out until we reopen.
                Families should turn in their April contracts with a start date of April 13th. As we continue to
                monitor the situation, we will inform everyone if our current plan changes. We understand the
                stress and hardship that many are going through with this unchartered territory. We hope that all
                will remain healthy and strong through this pandemic.

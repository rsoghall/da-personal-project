                At Dianne Adair, we are continuing to monitor the current situation and daily changes
                that are happening across our country and communities as efforts are made to slow down
                the spread of COVID - 19. We initially closed all centers but have now slowly begun
                reopening them. Please see the current scheduled dates for our centers to reopen below. During
                these closures,  Dianne Adair will continue to pay all employees their normal wages.
                Parents will be billed based on their contracted hours starting April 13th. Bills will
                not go out until we reopen. Families should turn in their April contracts with a start
                date of April 13th. As we continue to monitor the situation, we will inform everyone
                if our current plan changes. We understand the stress and hardship that many are going
                through with this unchartered territory. We hope that all will remain healthy and strong
                through this pandemic.

                Letter from a Parent
            </h1>
            
            <p> 
                I would like to express my thank you, as a parent, to the staff at
                Dianne Adair at Tice Creek for staying open during the coronavirus public
                emergency. This is despite all of the extraordinary measures that they take
                to clean the facility during this crisis while other childcare centers
                shutter. My wife and I know that our 3 kids are well taken care of all day
                with a few of their friends by caregivers with whom they are very familiar.
                It is like a family there.
            </p>
            <p>
                My wife is a manager at Kaiser Permanente's Walnut Creek Medical Center,
                just down Newell Road.  Besides the direct management of medical
                assistants and other medical staff facing an unprecedented health scare,
                she also is involved in Kaiser's contingency planning for the pandemic. 
                For the past several weeks, she has been working long hours and weekends
                related to the health emergency. She is working late this evening. That
                Dianne Adair at Tice Creek has been able to stay open has helped her
                concentrate on serving this important purpose. While overlooked by some
                of the public, this is precisely the intention of our public health
                officers in keeping certain childcare centers open and functioning
                (Contra Costa Health Services 3/16/2020 order, Â¶10.f.xxi).
            </p>
            <p>
                It is our hope that Dianne Adair remains open through the end of the
                crisis and when schools finally reopen. Other parents in the health
                care field who have children at Tice Creek should know that it is open.
                We hope that you understand our appreciation for Dianne Adair's service
                and, in their small way, helping our medical establishment deal with the
                unprecedented crisis.

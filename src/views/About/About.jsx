          Welcome to Dianne Adair Enrichment Programs web site. Welcome to
          Dianne Adair Enrichment Programs web site. Starting in 1983 with one
          location, Dianne Carbine opened Dianne Adair Daycare Centers with the
          ideal to bring safe, affordable daycare in an educational environment
          to working parents of school age children. Through her vision and
          guidance along with her husband Larry, we have grown to nine sites
          with over a hundred employees and have had thousands of children under
          our care. In 2003 Dianne and Larry retired turning the company over to
          the capable hands of Dianne’s son, Todd Porter, and Larry’s son, Brian
          Carbine and we became Dianne Adair Enrichment Programs. Together they
          have great plans for future growth while maintaining the integrity of
          the original dream. Please feel free to browse through our pages and
          to contact us any time at one of our sites or the main office for
          questions regarding daycare or employment opportunities.
